#Generated by claude. where in 
'''Separated recording from processing - Audio recording is now independent
Added explicit submit button - Processing only happens when you click "Analyze"
Added max_threads=10 - Allows concurrent operations
Removed automatic processing - Audio recording won't trigger processing

The root cause was likely that your original gr.Interface was trying to process the audio immediately when it was recorded, causing the server to be busy and interfering with the recording process.
Alternative quick fix for your original code:
Change your gr.Interface to process only on submit, not on input change:'''
